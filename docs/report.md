Agentic AI-Based Unattended Gas Stove Safety System

This project focuses on developing an Agentic AI-based safety system to address the issue of unattended gas stove usage in households. Gas stoves are frequently left unattended due to human distraction or multitasking, which can result in gas wastage, fire hazards, and environmental damage. Most existing solutions rely only on alarms or notifications and require human intervention, making them unreliable in critical situations. Hence, there is a need for an intelligent system that can make decisions and act autonomously.

The proposed solution introduces an Agentic AI-based system that continuously monitors gas usage and human presence in the kitchen. By integrating sensors with an intelligent decision-making mechanism, the system is capable of detecting unsafe conditions and automatically shutting off the gas supply. In addition, it alerts users to ensure immediate awareness of the situation. This autonomous behavior significantly enhances household safety while reducing energy wastage.

The system functions as an intelligent agent by perceiving its environment through sensors, reasoning about potential danger, and taking independent actions without human input. A key feature of the system is its ability to adapt based on user cooking patterns. By learning typical unattended durations, the system minimizes false alarms while maintaining a high level of safety. This adaptive behavior differentiates the solution from traditional rule-based systems and qualifies it as an Agentic AI application.

The workflow of the system begins with detecting gas leakage or gas flow from the stove. Simultaneously, it detects human presence in the kitchen using a presence-sensing mechanism. If gas is detected without human presence, the system analyzes the unattended duration and evaluates the risk level. When the situation is classified as hazardous, the system automatically shuts off the gas supply and triggers an alert to prevent accidents.

This project aligns primarily with SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production by reducing gas wastage and encouraging efficient energy usage. It also supports SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being by preventing domestic accidents and SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy by minimizing unnecessary fuel loss.

From a sustainability perspective, the system prevents gas wastage, reduces household emissions, improves safety and well-being, and promotes responsible energy consumption. Its small-scale design allows easy deployment in homes while remaining scalable to apartments, hostels, and community kitchens.

Responsible AI principles are carefully considered in this project. The system operates transparently with clearly defined decision logic, does not collect or store personal data, and processes all information locally to protect user privacy. The design is focused purely on safety and sustainability, ensuring ethical and trustworthy AI usage.

Overall, the proposed system has the potential to significantly reduce domestic gas-related accidents and fuel wastage. By combining autonomous decision-making, adaptive learning, and sustainability goals, the project demonstrates how Agentic AI can be effectively applied to solve real-world problems in everyday environments.
