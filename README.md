Agentic AI-Based Unattended Gas Stove Safety System

Overview
This project presents a small-scale Agentic AI system designed to detect unattended gas stove usage in households and autonomously take safety actions. The system reduces gas wastage, prevents domestic accidents, and promotes responsible energy consumption.

Problem Statement
Gas stoves left unattended are a major cause of household accidents and energy wastage. Existing systems mostly rely on alerts and lack autonomous decision-making.

Why Agentic AI?
The system behaves as an intelligent agent that:
- Senses gas flow and human presence
- Reasons about risk conditions
- Acts autonomously by shutting off gas
- Learns user behavior over time

SDG Alignment
- SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production (Primary)
- SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
- SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy

Tech Stack
- ESP32
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- PIR Motion Sensor
- Relay + Solenoid Valve
- Embedded C++ (Arduino)

System Workflow
1. Detect gas usage
2. Detect human presence
3. Analyze unattended duration
4. Learn user behavior
5. Automatically cut gas supply
6. Alert the user

Sustainability Impact
- Prevents gas wastage
- Reduces emissions
- Improves household safety

Responsible AI
- No personal data collection
- Transparent decision logic
- Local processing only

Future Enhancements
- Vision-based presence detection
- Multi-burner agent system
- Mobile notifications
- Cloud-based learning
